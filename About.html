    <p class="leftTitle">About Me</p class="leftTitle">
        <p class="boxedFont">I am a current student of the Grand Circus Bootcamp located in Grand Rapids MI.
            I am hoping to change my career path towards the tech career after graduating from Ferris State
            University when I earned my Bachelor in Television and Digital Media Production. As you can see
            by this website, there is much to work on with my career path. I am mainly a student of Visual
            Studio (C#/.NET), but I will also learn about CSS, HTML, JavaScript and more.
            <br><br>Once again, thank you for checking out my website! 
            <br>Also, be sure to check out the Portfolio tab.
